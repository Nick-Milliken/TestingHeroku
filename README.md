# TestingHeroku

### Getting model.py to run on heroku instead of Flask. 
First make sure your requirements.txt is current for heroku
This app will produce a landing page that reads Welcome to my Nightmare
This app will also produce a /table page that produces predictions on ratings for the ramen data set. 
My heroku site is https://fathomless-headland-59653.herokuapp.com/
If you wish to host your own app on heroku you will need to create routes that connect to your pickled model
Also, be sure you are up to date on your html skills. It is not very involved but there are some specific syntax issues that can be avoided if you brush up(if needed).
